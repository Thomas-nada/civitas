**Proposal:** Withdraw 3,810,423 ada for Mithril Protocol

# Rationale: gov_action1k02990lhw6wh74t7c6ufw3mqaek9ujtvyan99dj5qv5kvcs7pn8s24l0u4y
Recommendation: **NO**
Score: `-0.3133` (raw `-0.2833` + doctrine-LLM nudge `-0.03`) | Confidence: `0.8333` | Readiness: `0.0`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The claims include some checkable governance and smart-contract administration references, but the deterministic assessment identifies missing treasury analysis, feasibility assessment, risk analysis, alternatives analysis, and failure-mode analysis for a large treasury withdrawal. Under the doctrine, treasury stewardship and evidence quality justify a small cautionary negative nudge rather than a positive adjustment.

## Plain-language explanation (codex-offline-review)
BEACN records NO on Withdraw 3,810,423 ada for Mithril Protocol. The decisive concern is that the proposal's risks, precedent, or evidence gaps outweigh the case presented.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Treasury withdrawal to fund Mithril Protocol. The recorded treasury amount is 3,810,423. The strongest grounded claim is: The proposal requests 3,810,423 ada, consisting of 3,699,440 ada for Mithril Protocol Continuous Development and 110,983 ada for an Intersect Budget Administration fee.

A material weak point is that this claim remains proposer-asserted or thinly supported: Mithril uses stake-based threshold multi-signatures to certify Cardano state in a trustless way so nodes and applications can verify state rapidly without relying on the entire chain. The blocking questions are: missing complete proposal summary; missing budget analysis; missing feasibility assessment.

- finding: Deliverables: Mithril Protocol Continuous Development, Intersect Budget Administration fee, audit and oversight through Intersect and technically capable third-party, milestone-based disbursement controls
- finding: Deadline/expiry: not stated in document
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests 3,810,423 ada, consisting of 3,699,440 ada for Mithril Protocol Continuous Development and 110,983 ada for an Intersect Budget Administration fee.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): Mithril uses stake-based threshold multi-signatures to certify Cardano state in a trustless way so nodes and applications can verify state rapidly without relying on the entire chain.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The proposal says Mithril addresses slow full node synchronization and centralized trust assumptions for light clients.
- finding: Claim (adoption, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): The proposal states that faster sync times lower onboarding friction and unlock tooling for exchanges, wallets, and monitoring.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposal states it achieved the required 67% support threshold during the 2026 Intersect Budget Process Hydra Voting phase.
- finding: Claim (economic, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposal states the requested withdrawal did not, at submission, breach the applicable 350M Net Change Limit covering Epoch 613 to Epoch 713.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Mithril uses stake-based threshold multi-signatures to certify Cardano state in a trustless way so nodes and applications can verify state rapidly without relying on the entire chain.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal says Mithril addresses slow full node synchronization and centralized trust assumptions for light clients.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal states that faster sync times lower onboarding friction and unlock tooling for exchanges, wallets, and monitoring.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal states audit and oversight costs are included in the proposal overhead and that independent oversight will be provided through Intersect and technically capable third parties with reporting obligations and milestone-based disbursement controls.
- missing: complete proposal summary
- missing: budget analysis
- missing: feasibility assessment
- missing: risk analysis
- missing: alternatives analysis
- missing: failure-mode analysis

### Treasury analysis
- status: `incomplete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 3.81M ADA
- finding: Budget granularity: unknown
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: unknown (stale snapshot)
- finding: Financial confidence: unknown
- missing: line-item budget
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal requests 3,810,423 ada, consisting of 3,699,440 ada for Mithril Protocol Continuous Development and 110,983 ada for an Intersect Budget Administration fee." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "Mithril uses stake-based threshold multi-signatures to certify Cardano state in a trustless way so nodes and applications can verify state rapidly without relying on the entire chain." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- missing: missing complete proposal summary
- missing: missing budget analysis
- missing: missing feasibility assessment
- missing: missing risk analysis
- missing: missing alternatives analysis
- missing: missing failure-mode analysis
- missing: missing community impact analysis
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Inferences
- Doctrine-aware reasoning layer nudged the score by -0.030 (clamped to ±0.05): The claims include some checkable governance and smart-contract administration references, but the deterministic assessment identifies missing treasury analysis, feasibility assessment, risk analysis, alternatives analysis, and failure-mode analysis for a large treasury withdrawal. Under the doctrine, treasury stewardship and evidence quality justify a small cautionary negative nudge rather than a positive adjustment.

## Uncertainty
- Treasury diligence dossier incomplete; soft gate applied a -0.1 caution penalty and judged on available repo context (anchor + doctrine + reasoning lean) rather than abstaining.
- Treasury fee-flow snapshot is stale (epoch 621, ~19 epochs behind); regime treated as UNKNOWN and NOT scored. Refresh export_governance_risk_metrics.
- DRep ratification support is below threshold; this is not treated as active opposition.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: Mithril uses stake-based threshold multi-signatures to certify Cardano state in a trustless way so nodes and applications can verify state rapidly without relying on the entire chain.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal says Mithril addresses slow full node synchronization and centralized trust assumptions for light clients.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Treasury analysis missing: line-item budget
- Treasury analysis missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- Treasury analysis status is incomplete.
- Risk review missing: mitigation evidence
- Risk review missing: independent assurance
- Risk review status is thin.
- Synthesis missing: missing complete proposal summary
- Synthesis missing: missing budget analysis
- Synthesis status is blocked.
